# Basic Information

This course promotes open science practices, research synthesis standards, and stronger science in general.

This is a repository for my course "Meta-Analysis: Know How and Beyond". Here, you can find:
- [Syllabus](https://github.com/jbuczny/meta-analysis_know_how_and_beyond/blob/main/syllabus.md)

Visit the official VU [website](https://vu.nl/en/education/professionals/courses-programmes/meta-analysis-know-how-and-beyond) of the course to sign up. Note that if you sign up to the course, you will obtain access to prerecorded lectures, get an opportunity to submit assignments, and receive feedback.

## Additional Materials

This repository contains [additional materials](https://github.com/jbuczny/meta-analysis_know_how_and_beyond/blob/main/additional_materials.md) that expand the course by reflecting the current developments in the field of meta-analysis; it includes:
- Power analysis for multilevel models
- Consistency analysis
- Advanced techniques of publication bias detection
- References to the most recent articles in the field

## Co-Authored Meta-Analytic Projects

Here, you can find links showing the techniques I teach and use in my research. In addition, I keep track of my students' publication record to know how they use the knowledge they learn in my course.
