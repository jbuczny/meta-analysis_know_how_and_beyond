## Course Description

“Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential tools for summarizing evidence accurately and reliably (...)” (Liberati et al., 2009, p. 1). Currently, meta-analysis is widely applied technique for a multitude of reasons. For instance, to test and advance theories. It also is applicable to many of today’s issues tackling extensive scientific research, for example, to test the robustness of the relationship between variables across cultures. It can be used not only to conclude general effected size related to the studied relationships, but it is also essential for finding and estimating publication bias. Moreover, it can be applied in an a priori power analysis in the purpose to design sample size.

Within this course, students will learn how to formulate a problem and analyze it conducting a meta-analysis in JASP, a valuable open-science software. Also, students will have the opportunity to practice wide-and-far literature search and will learn how to report their findings following the PRISMA standards with professional assistance. Students will learn the basics on how to prepare and describe a meta-analytical study in a separate article as well. Moreover, students will be able to apply this technique to summarize studies described in a manuscript in order to improve argumentation and “publishability”, furthering academic and professional careers while building a strong skill-set and portfolio.
The course is organized in a form of an interactive seminar, in which students will perform four individual assignments, one each day. After a submission of each assignment, professional feedback will be provided.

## Major Topics

- Two types of systematic reviews
- Pros and cons of meta-analysis
- Publication bias and quality of publications
- Effect size and how to calculate it
- Literature search, exclusion, inclusion, and coding
- Available software, including JASP
- Fixed- and random-effects model
- Heterogeneity and its consequences
- Estimating overall effect size
- Analysis of moderators
- Estimating publication bias
- Gentle introduction to R, meta-analysis in R (briefly)
- Additional topics: meta-analysis of indirect effects, meta-CART, meta-plot, Bayesian meta-analysis

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Formulate a research question for meta-analysis
- Conduct an expansive literature search
- Systematically review relevant literature
- Code studies fitting inclusion criteria
- Meta-analyze using JASP software
- Interpret and report meta-analytic results
- Apply PRISMA standards to a report

## Software

Participants must install the following software:

- JASP, https://jasp-stats.org/download/
- jamovi, https://www.jamovi.org/download.html
- R, https://cran.r-project.org
- RStudio, https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download

## Course Organization and Schedule

### Before Starting the Course

1. Read the suggested literature.
2. Watch the first lecture shared via Canvas

The requrse requires approximately 26 hours of preparation.

### Course Format

- Prerecorded online lectures
- Working on assignments
- Online live sessions (shared later as recordings)
- Hands-on approach
- Approximately 10 hours of pre-recorded lectures
- Maximum 30 hours of sessions (Q&A, tutorials, and feedback)
- Individualized feedback after each assignment

Finishing this course requires at least six hours of work per day after the course starts on January 10 plus the time needed to watch lectures, reading the recommended literature, incorporating feedback and finishing the final assignment. In total, you will need to spend at least 80 hours to benefit from the course.

### Schedule

Schedule changes every year. In 2024, we started on January 8, and finished on January 19. This is a two-week hands-on course.

- **Unit 1: Introduction**
- **Unit 2: Literature Search and Coding**
- **Unit 3: Simple Analysis**
- **Unit 4: Advanced Analysis**
- **Unit 5: Reporting a Meta-Analysis and Advanced Aspects**

Please note that the schedule covers all possible activities, namely, summaries of the pre-recorded lectures, Q&A sessions, exercises in JASP and RStudio, discussions, and individual consultations. Participation in each session from the beginning until the end is not a must but is encouraged. Everyone will have an opportunity to adequately plan their time spent in the course.

### Assignments

Four assignments are planned.

**Assignment 1**
- Create an idea for your meta-analysis and prepare a working title.
- Briefly describe the goal of your meta-analysis (not more than 400 words).

**Assignment 2**
- Perform a literature search.
- Identify at least 8 suitable empirical articles.
- Prepare a search for unpublished studies.

**Assignment 3**
- Create a brief protocol and a coding form.
- Code at least eight studies into an Excel sheet.

**Assignment 4**
- Prepare a report using JASP.
- Analyze effects using both fixed and random effects models.
- Interpret results, create plots, and perform sensitivity analysis.

### Grading

To pass the course, participants must:
- Attend online meetings
- Actively participate
- Submit all assignments
- Obtain at least 60% of points for each assignment

The grade is based on performance in the assignments, using the standard the Dutch grading scale (1-10; 5.5 is sufficient).
