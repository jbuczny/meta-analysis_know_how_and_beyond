## Course Description

"Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential tools for summarizing evidence accurately and reliably..." (Liberati et al., 2009, p. 1). This course covers various aspects of meta-analysis, including formulating research questions, literature search, coding, and analysis using JASP software. Students will learn to report findings following PRISMA standards.

## Major Topics

- Two types of systematic reviews
- Pros and cons of meta-analysis
- Publication bias and quality of publications
- Effect size and how to calculate it
- Literature search, exclusion, inclusion, and coding
- Available software, including JASP
- Fixed- and random-effects model
- Heterogeneity and its consequences
- Estimating overall effect size
- Analysis of moderators
- Estimating publication bias
- Gentle introduction to R, meta-analysis in R (briefly)
- Additional topics: meta-analysis of indirect effects, meta-CART, meta-plot, Bayesian meta-analysis

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Formulate a research question for meta-analysis
- Conduct an expansive literature search
- Systematically review relevant literature
- Code studies fitting inclusion criteria
- Meta-analyze using JASP software
- Interpret and report meta-analytic results
- Apply PRISMA standards to a report

## Software

Participants must install the following software:

- JASP, https://jasp-stats.org/download/
- jamovi, https://www.jamovi.org/download.html
- R, https://cran.r-project.org
- RStudio, https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download

## Course Organization and Schedule

### Before Starting the Course

1. Read the suggested literature.
2. Watch the first lecture shared via Canvas. (Approximately 26 hours of preparation)

### Course Format

- Prerecorded online lectures
- Working on assignments
- Online live sessions (shared as recordings)
- Hands-on approach
- Approximately 10 hours of lectures
- Maximum 30 hours of sessions (Q&A, tutorial, and feedback)

## Schedule

Schedule changes every year. In 2024, we started on January 8, and finished on January 19.

- **Unit 1: Introduction**
- **Unit 2: Literature Search and Coding**
- **Unit 3: Simple Analysis**

## Assignments

Four assignments are planned:

1. **Assignment 1**
   - Create an idea for your meta-analysis and prepare a working title.
   - Briefly describe the goal of your meta-analysis (not more than 400 words).

2. **Assignment 2**
   - Perform a literature search.
   - Identify at least 8 suitable empirical articles.
   - Prepare a search for unpublished studies.

3. **Assignment 3**
   - Create a brief protocol and a coding form.
   - Code at least eight studies into an Excel sheet.

4. **Assignment 4**
   - Prepare a report using JASP.
   - Analyze effects using both fixed and random effects models.
   - Interpret results, create plots, and perform sensitivity analysis.

## Grading

To pass the course, participants must:
- Attend online meetings
- Actively participate
- Submit all assignments
